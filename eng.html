            <span>
                Social inequality occurs when people do not have the same opportunities or access to resources within a society. This can be seen in differences in income, education, healthcare, and rights. Wealthier people often have access to quality education, healthcare, and comfortable housing, while poorer individuals face difficulties in securing these basic rights.

                History of colonization and slavery: Brazil was colonized by Portugal, and for a long time, wealth was controlled by a few individuals who exploited enslaved workers. After the abolition of slavery in 1888, inequalities were not addressed, and the elites continued to control most of the country’s wealth. 
            </span>
            <span>
                Unequal distribution of wealth: In Brazil, a small portion of the population holds the majority of the wealth. This means that a minority has most of the money and resources, while many Brazilians live with very little. 
            </span>
            <span>
                Unequal education: Education in Brazil is not the same for everyone. Private schools often provide high-quality education, while public schools, especially in poorer regions, lack resources, making it harder for low-income students to learn.  
            </span>
            <span>
                Inequality in the labor market: Many people, especially those from lower social classes, work in precarious conditions and earn low wages, making it difficult for them to improve their living standards. 
            </span>
            <span>
                Political and economic factors: Brazil's political and economic systems often favor the elites, making it challenging to implement public policies that benefit the majority of the population. 
            </span>
            <span>
                Racial and social discrimination: Black, mixed-race, Indigenous people, and women face greater challenges in accessing quality jobs, education, and healthcare. Racial discrimination is a significant factor that exacerbates social inequality.

            <p>Social Inequality and Child Labor</p>
            <span>
                Social inequality in Brazil is closely linked to child labor, especially in families living in poverty. When a family lacks sufficient resources to survive, children are often forced to work to help support the household. Additionally: 
            </span>
            <span>
                Need to supplement family income: When parents earn too little and face financial difficulties, children are often sent to work, sometimes at the expense of studying or playing, which affects their future. 
            </span>
            <span>
                Lack of access to education: Many children cannot attend school because their families cannot afford school supplies, transportation, or even food. This leads them to join the workforce at an early age. 
            </span>
            <span>
                Misconceptions about child labor: In some regions, families believe it is normal for children to contribute to household income, perpetuating child labor even though it harms their development. 
            </span>
            <span>
                Exploitation of child labor: Informal work markets allow children to work without protection. They are often employed in hazardous activities, such as domestic work or street vending, often without fair pay or proper working conditions.

                Bolsa Família / Auxílio Brasil: Programs like Bolsa Família (now called Auxílio Brasil) provide financial assistance to poor families, helping them meet basic needs without requiring children to work.

            <span>
                Statute of the Child and Adolescent (ECA): The ECA guarantees the rights of children and adolescents in Brazil, prohibiting child labor and ensuring access to education, healthcare, and leisure. It aims to protect children and support their healthy development.

                Racial quota policies: Affirmative actions, such as racial quotas in universities and public sector jobs, help address historical inequalities by providing opportunities for historically marginalized groups, such as Black and mixed-race populations.

                We are a student team that produced a website about social inequality, integrating the subjects of Geography and English. We created this website with the intention of drawing the attention of more students to find out more and delve deeper into this subject, which is super important, and even so they can study to take a test, entrance exam and even an enem.
